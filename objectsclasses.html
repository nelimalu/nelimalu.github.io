			<h1>[comp sci] / objects & classes</h1>
			<p>
				objects and classes are the basis of Java programming<br>
				classes and objects are difficult to understand, so don’t worry if it takes a while!
			</p>
			<h3>/What is a class?</h3>
			<p>
				A class is a template for an object
				<br>it will specify what attributes something you’re trying to code will have
				<br>for example, a dog will have a set of attributes including
				<ul>
					<li>name</li>
					<li>breed</li>
					<li>age</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To give these attributes specific values, we need to create an object</p>
			</p>
			<h3>/What is an object?</h3>
			<p>
				An object is a specific <b>instance</b> of a class
				<br>a common analogy is a cookie cutter
				    <br>a cookie cutter has a shape, and each cookie made from the cookie cutter will have that same shape, but they are each individual cookies (or objects)
				<br>When we create an object, we can give each attribute a specific value
				<br>for example, using the attributes from above
				<ul>
					<li>name = Randall</li>
					<li>breed = Husky</li>
					<li>age = 6</li>
				</ul>
				<p>we can create as many objects (individual dogs with specific attributes) as we want from a class (the template of the dog, outlining that it will have a name, breed, and age)</p>
			</p>

			<h2>How to write a class</h2>
			<p>
				here is an example of a class using the dog example above
			</p>
			<pre>
public class Dog {
	String name;
	String breed;
	int age;
}</pre>

 			<p>
				<br>To create an object of the Dog class, and give the dog a specific name, breed and age, we need a <b>constructor.</b>
			    <br>A constructor is a unique method that called when a new object is being created.
			    <br>It is always public, has no return type, and has the same name as the class (case sensitive)
				<br>Here is an example of a constructor for the dog class
			</p>
			<pre>
public class Dog {
	String name;
	String breed;
	int age;

	public Dog(String n, String b, int a) {
		name = n;
		breed = b;
		age = a;
	}
}</pre>
			<p>
				For each attribute of the class, a parameter is added to the constructor
				<br>make sure that the name of the parameter is different from the name of the attribute
				<br>in the future we can use the <c>this</c> keyword to avoid this naming issue
			</p>

 			<h2>How to create an object</h2>

 			<p>
				for most programs, we will have a separate driver class with a main method
				<br>a driver class usually only has one method, which is the main method
				<br>this is where the code will begin executing
				<br>Here is an example of a driver class
			</p>

<pre>
public class Driver {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("hello!");
	}
}
</pre>

			<p>
				<br>The driver class must be saved in the same folder as your other class, in this example, the Dog class
				<br>Here is an example of your file structure
			</p>

<pre>
DogProject
├── Driver.java
└── Dog.java
</pre>

			<p>
				<br>We will create a dog object within the driver class
				<br>Here is an example of creating an object
			</p>

<pre>
public class Driver {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Dog my_dog_object = new Dog("Randall", "Husky", 6);

	}
}
</pre>

			<p>
				notice that `Dog` is being used as a data type of this variable
			    <br>this is a very important concept to understand: ***classes are essentially just data types***
			    <br>the variable `my_dog_object` is a variable of type `Dog`
				<br>To create a new object (an **instance** of the dog class), we use the `new` keyword
				<br>We then write the name of the class, and in brackets, write all the parameters of the constructor
				<br>notice that in the constructor written above, we specified the following:
			</p>

<pre>
public Dog(String n, String b, int a) {  // pay attention to the order of
	name = n;                            // parameters here
	breed = b;
	age = a;
}
</pre>

			<p>
				the order in which we wrote the parameters in the constructor is the order in which we enter the values of the attributes when we create a new object
				<br>In this example, the order is `name` , `breed` , `age`
				<br>This is why when we create the object, we do `new Dog("Randall", "Husky", 6)`
				<br>we can also create multiple objects from the same class
			</p>

			<h2>Manipulating objects</h2>
			<p>
				we already saw how objects have attributes
				<br>objects can also have methods
				<br>methods are blocks of code that manipulate the attributes of an object
				<br>To understand how methods work, let’s consider another example: a bank account
			</p>
<pre>
public class BankAccount {
	String accountName;
	double balance;
	double interestRate;
}
</pre>
			
			<p>
				a bank account may have some functions, like depositing money, withdrawing money, or applying interest
				<br>we can create a method for each of these
			</p>

<pre>
public class BankAccount {
	String accountName;
	double balance;
	double interestRate;

	// constructor
	public BankAccount(String a, double b, double i) {
		accountName = a;
		balance = b;
		interestRate = i;
	}

	public void withdraw(double amount) {
		balance -= amount;  // subtract the amount from the balance
	}

	public void deposit(double amount) {
		balance += amount;  // add the amount to the balance
	}

	public void applyInterest() {
		balance *= (1 + interestRate);  // add one so it increases by the interest amount
	}
}
</pre>
			
			<p>
				now let’s create some objects (or instances) of the BankAccount
				<br>We can print the attributes of specific objects by using `.`
			</p>

<pre>
public class Driver {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// bank account with name luka, $100 in the bank, and 5% interest rate
		BankAccount LukaAccount = new BankAccount("Luka", 100, 0.05);
		// bank account with name Krasteva, $153.67 in the bank, and 2% interest rate
		BankAccount KrastevaAccount = new BankAccount("Krasteva", 153.67, 0.02);

		System.out.println(LukaAccount.accountName);
		System.out.println(KrastevaAccount.balance);
	}
}

/*
OUTPUT

Luka
153.67
*/
</pre>

			to run methods of an object, we simply use `.methodName()` and add any parameters in the brackets

<pre>
public class Driver {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		BankAccount LukaAccount = new BankAccount("Luka", 100.0, 0.05);
		BankAccount KrastevaAccount = new BankAccount("Krasteva", 153.67, 0.02);

		System.out.println(LukaAccount.balance);
		LukaAccount.deposit(25.0);
		System.out.println(LukaAccount.balance);
		System.out.println(KrastevaAccount.balance);
	}
}

/*
OUTPUT

100.0
125.0
153.67
*/
</pre>
			<p>
				this may be kind of obvious, but notice how running .deposit on Luka’s account does not affect the balance of Krasteva’s account, even though they are objects of the same class
				<br>you can probably imagine how the other methods work
				<br>hopefully you understand all that! if not, try watching youtube videos on the topic can confirm they explain very well
			</p>
