			<h1>[comp sci] / overloading & overriding</h1>
			
			<h2>Overloading</h2>

			overloading a method is just creating two methods with the same name, but different parameters

<pre>
public class Helper {
	public int add(int x, int y) {
		return x + y;
	}

	public String add(String x, String y) {
		return x + " " + y;
	}
}
</pre>
			
			<p>
				in the above example, I have two methods called `add()` but one of them takes two integers as a parameter, and one takes two Strings
				<br>in memory, these are saved as two separate methods
				<br>also notice that the bodies of the methods don’t have to be the same, as we can see in the add method with strings were it appends a space in between the two Strings
				<br>this makes it easier for anyone working on your code in the future to not have to remember separate methods that do the same thing just with different datatypes
				<br>here is an example of running these overloaded methods
			</p>

<pre>
public class Driver {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Helper helper = new Helper();

		System.out.println(helper.add(1, 2));
		System.out.println(helper.add("Luka", "Jovanovic"));

		/*
		OUTPUT

		3
		Luka Jovanovic
		*/
	}
}
</pre>
			
			<p>
				overloaded methods are often used in class constructors to define some default values
				<br>consider this `Person` class
			</p>

<pre>
public class Person {
	String name;
	int age;

	public Person() {
		this.name = "default";
		this.age = 0;
	}

	public Person(String name) {
		this.name = name;
		this.age = 0;
	}

	public Person(int age) {
		this.name = "default";
		this.age = age;
	}

	public Person(String name, int age) {
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}
}
</pre>
			
			<p>
				in this case, we have four overloaded constructors, each with different parameters
				<br>it accounts for each possible scenario, and fills unsupplied values with default values
				<br>if we have a lot of parameters, we can also use `this` to save time
				<br>consider these two methods
			</p>

<pre>
public Person(String name) {
	this.name = name;
	this.age = 0;
}

public Person(int age) {
	this.name = "default";
	this.age = age;
}
</pre>
			
			<p>
				in these cases, we are redefining `this.name = "default"` and `this.age = 0` redundantly, since it was already defined in the first constructor
				<br>it would also get very annoying to write if we have more attributes
				<br>we can write this more concisely
			</p>

<pre>
public class Person {
	String name;
	int age;

	public Person() {
		this.name = "default";
		this.age = 0;
	}

	public Person(String name) {
		this();  // runs the constructor above, and sets name and age to default values
		this.name = name;  // overrides name, but leaves age = 0
	}

	public Person(int age) {
		this();  // same thing applies here
		this.age = age;
	}

	public Person(String name, int age) {
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}
}
</pre>

		<h2>Overriding</h2>

		<p>
			method overriding is redefining a method of a superclass in a subclass
			<br>if a superclass is needed for a subclass, but we want to change the functionality of one specific method that doesn’t fit a need, we override it
			<br>consider this example
		</p>

<pre>
public class Person {
	String name;

	public Person(name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public void eat() {
		System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
	}

	public void move() {
		System.out.println(name + " is walking.");
	}

}
</pre>

<pre>
public class Athlete extends Person {

	public Athlete(String name) {
		super(name);
	}

	public void move() {
		System.out.println(name + " is RUNNING!");
	}
}
</pre>

		notice that the Athlete subclass has a method called `move()` even though there is already a method with that name in the superclass

<pre>
public class Driver {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Person tim = new Person("tim");
		Athlete bob = new Athlete("bob");

		tim.move();
		bob.move();
		bob.eat();

		/*
		OUTPUT:
		tim is walking.
		bob is RUNNING!
		bob is eating.
		*/
	}
}
</pre>
		
			<p>
				in this example, we can see that `tim`, being of type `Person`, can call the `.move()` method
				<br>`bob`, of subclass `Athlete`, can also call the `.move()` method, however it is overridden, so it calls the method defined in `Athlete` over the one defined in `Person`
				<br>However, `bob` can still run `.eat()`, a method defined in `Person`
