			<h1>[comp sci] / javadoc comments</h1>
			<p>
				Javadoc comments are html snippets that are used to summarize a class, method, or attribute
				<br><br>
				what a javadoc comment includes:
				<ul>
			    	<li>brief summary</li>
			    	<li>parameters</li>
			    	<li>return value</li>
			   	</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>/Why do we use javadocs?</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Doc</b>umentation (where the <b>doc</b> comes from in java<b>doc</b>) is a very important part of code, and is used to help others use and understand code that you write.
				<br>Usually, when someone makes a program, it will feature many classes with many methods. It’s not feasible for another programmer to go through your code and find the function of each method by looking at comments.<br>Documentation is a place where all methods and classes are summarized so programmers can easily find and use specific methods.
				<br>Since documentation is a generally boring task, where you’ve finished writing the code and now you’re just writing descriptions and explanations of methods, the javadoc was made!
				<br>Javadocs make it so that a programmer writing in Java can write their documentation as they’re writing their code, so they don’t have to do it later
				<br>These javadoc comments can then be parsed by a fancy javadoc generator, and create your own documentation website for you
				<br>The website aspect is the reason we can use html within our javadocs
				<br>Essentially, for a small program with one or two files, javadocs are useless, but they are great practice for if you may write a large scale library in the future.
			</p>
			<h3>/Example of Documentation</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="https://docs.gl/gl2/glAccum">https://docs.gl/gl2/glAccum</a>
				<br><br>OpenGL is a famous program used to create 3D graphics
				<br>Usually, large programs such as this are actually a compilation of thousands of small programs which together are called a <b>library</b>
				<br>In this example, we have a random method called <c>glAccum()</c> which is not a very descriptive name, and would be hard for a programmer to figure out what it’s used for
				<br>Luckily, the documentation explains every aspect of this method
				<br>It lists the parameters, return values, and how they’re used
				<br>It also has a description to help you understand how this method is used, and when to use it
			</p>

			<h2>Writing a Javadoc Comment</h2>
			<p>
				A Javadoc comment is a multiline comment
				<br>The first line has two asterisks *
				<br>All following lines have an asterisk preceding the line

			</p>
			<br>Example:
			<pre>
/**
 * this is an example javadoc comment 
 */</pre>

 			<p>
				Javadoc comments can also include html tags, because javadocs get compiled into HTML.
				<br>This can be used to emphasize parts of a javadoc comment
			</p>
			<pre>
/**
 * &lt;h1&gt;This text is going to appear bigger&lt;/h1&gt;
 * than this text
 */</pre>

 			<h2>Javadoc for a class</h2>
 			<p>
 				Class javadocs are a more professional version of "four top line comments" taught in previous ICS classes.
				<br>This comment summarizes the function of a class
				<br>It also includes the author (your name), the date, as well as a version number.
				<br>Put an @ symbol in front of your name and version number
 			</p>
 			<h3>/More on version numbers</h3>
 			<p>
 				Version numbers can be confusing, but if you’re writing a big program that you may be working on for months, every time you make a big change to your code you would change the version number.
				<br>Think how minecraft (a java program) has version numbers like <c>1.0</c>, <c>1.8.9</c>, <c>1.19</c>, etc.
				<br>It’s also common to have a version like <c>beta 1.0</c>
				<br>Prefixes like <c>alpha</c> or <c>beta</c> are used to show a user that your program is not complete, and may have frequent bugs.
 			</p>
 			Example:
 			<pre>
/**
 * &lt;h1&gt;This text is going to appear bigger&lt;/h1&gt;
 * than this text
 */</pre>

 			<h2>Javadoc for a method</h2>
 			<p>
 				A method javadoc summarizes what a method is supposed to do.
				<br>It specifies the parameters and the return value, with a short description for each.
				<br>Remember to put an @ symbol in front of parameter and return
 			</p>
 			Example:
 			<pre>
/**
 * add method to easily add two numbers
 * 
 * @param a First integer to be added
 * @param b Second integer to be added
 * @return The sum of a and b
 */
public int add(int a, int b) {
	return a + b;
}</pre>

			<h2>Javadoc for an attribute (field)</h2>
			<p>
				This is usually one line, and simply explains the use of the attribute.
			</p>
			Example:
			<pre>
/** The age of the person */
private int age;</pre>
		</div>
 
<!--
 <pre>
